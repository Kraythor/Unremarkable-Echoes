That was the first sentence of Dune, the novel by Frank Herbert. The first time I tried to read that sentence, I didn't get it. English is not my first language and I've never studied English literature beside some poorly translated web novels. Instead of continuing reading the novels. I pondered at that sentence, trying to make sense of it. I watched Dune the movie so I'm not curious how the story progress. So I abandoned the book.

  

Fast forward to today, I tried to write my first blog and I choose beginning as the title. I didn't know what to write so instead I am writing about the first step of making this website. Actually the website has been made mostly. What you see here are made from a template that actually you could read on the bottom of this page.

  

"Why I am making this website."

  

For learning purposes, this website would be the first website that I ever deployed. So I expect it to be simple and uninteresting to the common folks. Honestly I didn't expect any visitor. If you reading this. Then it was either because I personally recommended this website to you, your fate brought you here, the products of butterfly effect, or you are conducting a malicious investigation on me. If it was the last one, then I apologize for any transgression that are concocted by my future self.

  

"What is in this website?"

  

Good question! I am not sure yet.

  

"...."

  

What, this is the first time I am deploying a website and post a real content. I have a vague plan what this website gonna be. I'm gonna talk about my interest. Yeah, classic, I know I can do it somewhere. Like on blogger, Facebook, YouTube, tumblr, reddit, and even AO3 (yes, I've been there) or 4chan (yes, I've been *there* too).

  

Why making your own website?

  

As I said, it is for learning how to make and deploy a website. Also this template was also the most convenient blogsite that I had ever encounter. Seriously, making a webpage was never been easier. Checkout Tablog minimalistic blog theme by clicking the link below on the bottom of the page. Then you would understand what I mean.

  

As I said before, I am gonna talk about my interests. So what are they? Kinda something generic like video games, anime, manga, little bit of movies and novels. Also I dabbled in creative endeavour. So there's going to be some contents about creative writing and game development. In the past I also had passing interest in art, music, and animation. Which I abandoned because the lack of drive to delve deeper into those studies. Also, I'm not very talented. So I kinda pessimistic about those.

So yeah, I'm going to talk about my favorites of each form of arts. I'm also going to talk about the project that I'm making. If you interested then stay tuned! and follow me on platform bellow so that I know so that I know that someone really following me on this. If by some miracle you found this website. Then you are taking interest on what I am talking about and following me on social media. Your presence would be the greatest motivation for me now that I know that I'm not useless piece of shit. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

A successful morning routine can set the tone for the entire day, helping us to feel more focused, productive, and energized. By establishing a consistent and structured morning routine, we can create a sense of order and control in our lives, and set ourselves up for success.

One of the key elements of a successful morning routine is to wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends and holidays. This helps to regulate our internal clock, and ensures that we get enough sleep each night.

Once you have established a consistent wake-up time, the next step is to create a routine that works for you. This can include activities such as exercise, meditation, or journaling, as well as more practical tasks such as making the bed or getting dressed. The key is to find a routine that fits your schedule and your personal goals.

Another important element of a successful morning routine is to avoid starting the day with distractions, such as checking your email or scrolling through social media. Instead, focus on activities that help you to feel calm and focused, such as meditation or journaling. This will help you to start the day with a clear mind, and set you up for success.

Overall, a successful morning routine can make a big difference in your day-to-day life. By establishing a consistent wake-up time, creating a routine that works for you, and avoiding distractions, you can set yourself up for a more focused, productive, and fulfilling day.
