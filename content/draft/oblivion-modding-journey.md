Yesterday, the remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion was released without any official news. Suddenly Bethesda reputation was elevated from the disaster of which was Starfield. Everybody praising them and they deserve it. Without any hyping of marketing, the game released to the public without any expectation. It is not a masterpiece and everybody expected that. It is Oblivion after all, the reputation was established that it is an old classic with numerus bugs and janky AI. They just released just a better-looking oblivion and everyone is happy. Except probably me.

Why I am not happy?

It was because I can run it on any of my pc. Oblivion Remastered was made using Unreal Engine 5  and that means it using high quality but poorly optimized graphic. it has 20 bigger file size than the classic version. And it require beefy modern computer that I have yet able to afford. Despite in these situation, my interest had not yet wane. So I decided to play the classic. Not only I'm gonna download it, I'll also gonna mod it to oblivion.

So with that I started to download Oblivion from trusted source. I install it, run it, and there it is. The original Oblivion, full with its jank and bug. I never had to play Oblivion before this. I play Skyrim and I know where it comes from now that I look at the broken mess. It has a charm only old game has and I understand why this game was popular at the time.
